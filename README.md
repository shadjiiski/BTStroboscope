# BTStroboscope
Arduino based stroboscope with different remote control implementations

A simple bluetooth-controlled stroboscope is made out of a Arduino UNO with HC-06 Bluetooth receiver atached. Here are presented (for archiving purposes) the firmware code (Arduino sketch) and two remote control applications: a Android application and a Desktop application (javax.swing)

###TODO
* add arduino shield schematic
* code cleanup
* better Android application life-cycle management
* investigate Android application random crashes
* make Desktop application more portable and easier to extend
